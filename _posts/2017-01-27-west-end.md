*Friday 27th January 2017*

We kicked off last weekend with a visit to the West End. In November, I had
bought tickets to Aladdin to surprise Markus when he arrived in the London. The
day finally came...

Markus had no idea where we were going, even when we arrived in front of the
theatre! Not surprisingly, when I told him, he had no change in
expression...although he says he was very excited.

We went to the Prince Edward Theatre in Soho! The decor in theatres is always interesting...

Markus was very impressed by the curtain! We had seats at the very back of the theatre.

Aladdin was fantastic! We were both in awe of the amazing costumes and back sets. It was an adaption of the Disney film. Here are some pictures from online.

The colours were vivid and beautiful, and it was very entertaining. Afterwards, we went on a walk through Soho, Chinatown and Covent Garden...
