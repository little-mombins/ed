*Sunday 7th January 2017*

Our next adventure around West London was Hyde Park/Kensington. We are
fortunate to live right next to Hyde Park, so we can go on walks through nature
whenever the desire takes us...

We walked diagonally through Hyde Park, from the North-West side to the South-East side. We ambled through Kensington Gardens, past the Pond, along the Serpentine down to Knightsbridge. Whilst we were walking, we were able to tick off another London tourist essential---a photo in front of the red telephone boxes!

What else is there to do in Knightsbridge, apart from go to Harrods and watch the rich Arabs illegally speed in their Ferraris and Porsches?

The highlight of our trip was visiting the famous Harrods food court! We bought a pork pie and a Scotch egg. We were also lucky enough to try a variety of samples, including the best macaroon I've ever had.

After eating, we walked around the store, but soon became fatigued by the crowds, oppressively low ceilings and bizarre layout. In our delirium, we nearly bought a designer coat that cost as much as a year's college education, but somehow we resisted the temptation...

We cleared our heads by walking down Brompton Road. We passed the London Oratory, a beautiful Roman Catholic Church. We decided to go in, and were handed a pamphlet at the entrance. I was seriously horrified to see that it was an anti-abortion advertisement! I was so disgusted that I gave the pamphlet back and took a furtive photo inside the Church despite there being 'No Photos Allowed' signs everywhere. Take that!

After stopping by the Church, we walked down to the museums on Cromwell Road. Luckily for us, the ice-skating rink was still open. It was very magical to see.

We then cut up to Kensington High Street. As it was dark at this point, we decided against walking through the park at night. Instead, we casually strolled up [Kensington Palace Gardens](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/apr/07/londons-most-expensive-street-kensington-palace-gardens) to get home, which happens to be the most expensive street in Britain.

A very posh day, with a fitting end.
