*Saturday 28th January 2017*

Markus and I were feeling exhausted, but we finally managed to leave the house
around 3pm. We went for a walk through Hyde Park to go to Marble Arch, where
Markus could go suit shopping for the House of Lords Chinese New Year's Party
on Monday.

On our way through the park, there was a hail storm that left a beautiful
rainbow in its wake. We arrived at Marble Arch to do some shopping.

We felt energised after shopping, so we walked down Oxford Street to Soho.
Unfortunately, as it was a Saturday night, we couldn't find a spot in any of
the restaurants! We ended up walking around for a long time, and decided to
fortify ourselves with a snack.

Fun fact: when I went to China, I bought some street food thinking it was these
waffles. It turned out to be quail eggs, and I ended up with extremely bad food
poisoning.

We tried to go to Chinatown, seeing as it was Chinese New Year, but predictably
all the restaurants were full. We ended up in a fake American diner! Pretty
embarrassing, since we had just come back from the US...still, Markus enjoyed
the food!
