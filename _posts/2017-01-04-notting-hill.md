*Wednesday January 4th 2017*

Our first foray into London was to Notting Hill, home of the famous Portobello
Market and Notting Hill Carnival, and famed for being affluent, chic and having
many picturesque, colourful houses. Notting Hill was also the inspiration
behind the British romcom---wait for it---'Notting Hill'- which stars Julia
Roberts and Hugh Grant, and pushed Hugh Grant into the spotlight as a modern
day Mr. Darcy. Note: I have never watched Notting Hill.

Notting Hill is only a 15 minute walk away from my flat. Us Mombins decided to
venture out in the early afternoon, so we could spend the rest of the day
exploring.

Unfortunately, Portobello Market wasn't open due to it being a Wednesday. This
didn't deter us, however- the absence of the usual throngs of tourists allowed
us to walk around at a leisurely pace.

We popped into [La Cave à Fromage](http://www.la-cave.co.uk/) which,
according to their website, is the world's 3rd most amazing cheese shop! It was
very European, and had the strong fragrance of blue cheese.

We stopped into my favourite used book store, the Oxfam bookshop on Portobello
Road. We spent several happy hours perusing the books, and ended up purchasing
several excellent copies which we have yet to read.

We stopped in a variety of other cute boutiques, including a beautiful Japanese
store named [Wasokan](http://tikichris.com/2016/01/21/wasokan-notting-hill/),
which sells matcha and kimonos. It was very special to look through all the
kimonos, which were gorgeous and expensive.

I also picked up an octopus broach from a thrift store for £4! If this doesn't
sum up my personality, I don't know what does. Some people have even said it
looks like me, based on its shocked expression and wavy arms.

Overall a lovely afternoon in one of London's most charming neighbourhoods.
