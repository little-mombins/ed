*Monday 30th January 2017*

I was invited to a Chinese New Year's party at the House of Lords by the
Confucius Institute, the organisation that sponsored my trip to Beijing.
Neither of us had been to the House of Lords before, so it was pretty exciting!
I also had no idea what to expect. About 150 people turned up, and we had
drinks and canapes.

We had to walk through protests at Westminster. These notices were everywhere.

It ended up being a really fun evening. All the people who came with me on the
Beijing trip were there, so it was great to catch up and see everyone.

That said, the canapes were awful. Both of us were shocked by how strange and
awful they were. Luckily, the group decided to go to Chinatown afterwards for a
late meal. We ended up staying out until around midnight.
